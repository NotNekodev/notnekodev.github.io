    <h2>Hello! I'm Myles Wilson</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a software engineer from Nottingham, England, passionate about building clean, responsive and
        high-performance solutions to real world problems and a brother of 4 sisters
        <br>
        <br>
        I've Crafted e-commerce websites for local businesses and have extensive experience in the C language from
        Writing Hyper Fast Webservers to Hobby Operating Systems
        along-side this I have experience in writing small video games. All driven by curiosity and a love for creative
        problem solving and understanding esoterics.

    <p>
        From hobby projects to professional work I have no issue diving into a new environment with determination this
        keeps me constantly learning, iterating and pushing
        my own personal boundries showing myself I can go further. There's always more to master and I thrive on turning
        complex challenges into elegent, real world and sustainable
        soloutions
    </p>

    <p>
        Everything I make solves a problem and I do it in my own unique way that brings something new to the table each
        and every time, pushing my own boundries and
        giving myself a new sense of achievement each and every time. something I hold close to influence my growth as
        not only a programmer but a learning person
    </p>

    <h2>My Achievements</h2>

    <h3>The Bleed Kernel: Bespoke x86_64 Operating System</h3>
    <p>
        I wrote an operating system in C and x86 Assembly that works on real life hardware.
        <br>
        <strong>It supports things such as</strong> PS/2 Keyboard Input, File Systems, Executing Programs, Memory
        Management and Allocation, Userspace and has its own Terminal
        <br>
        <br>
        as you can see in the image below this is <strong>the bleed kernel running a standalone terminal
            program,</strong> browsing through the file system and reading files, and even
        running another program inside the shell, commanded by the user.

    <h3>SpecSeek: Know everything about your hardware</h3>
    <p>
        I wrote an Extreamly Portable and Verbose CPU Specifications Interpreter using a single assembly instruction
        CPUID as the backend.
        Many people in the "Hobby Operating Systems" Community wrote working ports for my software to their own
        execution environments.
        <br>
        Specseek allows for anyone to know exactly what their processor is capable of right down to the individual
        instructions it supports.

    <h3>Livefs: the C fileserver</h3>
    <p>
        I wrote an extreamly fast static serve file server in C and I was able to achieve <strong>less than 1ms</strong> server request processing
                times using performant C code, file caching, Multi-threaded Execution and a Flat Permissions Model
    </p>

    <p>
        My flat permissions model dictates that permissions are not bound to the individual but it is actaully down to
        the parent folder, as a result, the higher the
        folder in the directory heirarchy, the more authority the folder has. this allows for fast setup, cutting out
        the permissions and authentication time allowing for
        faster response times. which is fantastic for files or websites that are expected to be accessed by the public
        or for fast setup over a local network to access
        shared folders over devices.
    </p>

    <h2>Modus operandi</h2>
    <p>
        I approach each project and my work with confidence and an obligation to create high quality deliverables to the
        end user, I choose my Technology Stack on a
        case by case basis and what tool is best for the job, not following trends.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Performance, Response Time and Memory Footprint matter, I prefer working in C where I can fully account for
        each and every Memory Allocation, this
        allows me to create responsive, predictable and efficent software,
    </p>
    <p>
        When Broader Platform support and stability is required I leverage the Platform Agnostic Design of Languages
        such as Java to cut a balance between
        portability and maintainability. My priority lies with the result as my tools are oriented arround the
        requirments of each individual project.
    </p>
    <p>
        to achieve this I've always needed to step out of my comfort zone to become familiar with different languages
        and technologies:
        <br>
        such as C, C++, Rust, Java, TypeScript, Javascript and x86 Assembly
    </p>
