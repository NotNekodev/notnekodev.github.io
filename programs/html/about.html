    <h2>Hi There</h2>
    <p>I'm Nekodev, a programmer from Germany who is interested in low level topics like Operating Systems and Linux development.
        I have other hobbies outside of programming; I am a passionate Formula 1 fan and I take some interest in photography from time to
        time. I also enjoy playing the violin, which I have been doing regulary since April 3. 2020, so for <time id="since" datetime="2020-04-03">2020-04-03</time> now. </p>
    </br>
    <p>I am also active in emergency services, both in by being a volunteer in the volunteer fire department and as a member of the German Red Cross.
    </p>

    <p>I started my programming journes in mid 2020 when the Covid pandemic hit large parts of Germany and leaving the house was difficult.
        My first project was a simple HTML + CSS + JS calculator that I made to learn the basics of web development. I loved playing Minecraft
        back then, so I quickly moved on to Mod Making using GUI tools like MCreator. After a while I finally decided to learn Java and write mods
        from scratch. Then one day I found out about C and was fascinated by the power it gives you. The one fateful day I stumbled upon an Operating System development tutorial
        was in a summer vacation in 2022. From then on that is what I remain most interested in, while still doing user-space programming in C and Java development.
