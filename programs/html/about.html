    <h2>Hi There</h2>
    <p>I'm Nekodev, a programmer from Germany who is interested in low level topics like Operating Systems and Linux development.
        I have other hobbies outside of programming; I am a passionate Formula 1 fan and I take some interest in photography from time to
        time. I also enjoy playing the violin, which I have been doing regulary since April 3. 2020, so for <time id="since" datetime="2020-04-03">2020-04-03</time> now.
